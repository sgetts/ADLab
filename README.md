<h3>Hello, GitHub community,
I hope you are all doing well. My presence here hasn’t been as consistent as I’d like, and I've realized that I haven’t been showcasing the projects and home labs I tackle in my free time. Moving forward, I plan to document my labs and share my journey with all of you.

In the realm of IT, continuous learning and experimentation are key. To foster this environment, I've created my own Discord server. It's a space where I enjoy teaching other IT enthusiasts and professionals some of my skills acquired from being in the field, as well as exchanging knowledge and fueling our collective passion for technology. I've had the privilege of engaging with various communities, including seasoned professionals such as pentesters, who possess a wealth of experience in the field. I am eager to not only take the insights and knowledge gained from these experts but also to leverage it as an advantage in my IT work. This cycle of continuous learning and mentorship is something I'm deeply passionate about—we absorb wisdom from the best, apply it to excel in our roles, and then impart our enhanced expertise to other IT enthusiasts.

Today, I had the pleasure of guiding over eight individuals through the initial setup and configuration of a fundamental Windows Server 2019 environment, functioning as a Domain Controller with Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). The session also included integrating a Windows 11 client into the lab domain. This allowed me to sign into newly created user accounts, which I efficiently provisioned using a PowerShell script—a practical demonstration of automating the creation of hundreds of dummy accounts for our lab setup.

Roles & Features Configured on the Windows Server 2019:

-Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

-DHCP Server

-DNS Server

Key Network Configurations:

-Established a FQDN for the AD environment: labdomain.com

-Configured DHCP with a scope of 172.16.0.100-200, allowing dynamic IP allocation within our network.

-Set up DNS services to resolve domain requests and facilitate network communication.

In our lab virtual environment, running on VirtualBox as a Type 2 Hypervisor, we witnessed the seamless interaction between server and client machines. This demonstration not only solidified foundational knowledge but also showcased the practical application of scripting in PowerShell to streamline administrative tasks.

I look forward to bringing more of my home lab adventures to this platform.
